<h1>GAMMA NU CHAPTER</h1>
<h2>Gamma Nu History</h2>
<p>The Gamma Nu chapter officially received its charter from Beta Theta Pi on December 30, 1926.  It is currently located at 581 Gayley Ave., a historic home that was built in the early 1900s.<br><br>
<b>Education</b><br><br>
At a large public university of over 28,000 undergraduates, Beta quickly introduces our new members to a tight knit community of around 100 brothers, all from various backgrounds culturally and educationally. As UCLA students first and foremost, our chapter puts school at the forefront of our priorities. From Bio-Chemical majors to History and Political Science majors, we pride ourselves in having one of the most diverse ranges in educational pursuits, while consistently ranking in the top 3 average GPA's among other fraternities. Our success in education comes not only from our rigorous selection of members but also from the exclusive services that our chapter provides to its members. As the first national fraternity to establish a minimum GPA requirement, Gamma Nu as a chapter works proactively to push our members by booking study rooms at the crowded libraries weekly throughout the quarter and requiring struggling brothers to attend study hours to help rebound from any poor performances. Our house itself also receives a yearly scholarship for having its own study quarters, where brothers are encouraged to take advantage of a sound-proof chapter room below the house. As an added bonus, our housing corps provides a quarterly scholarship of $100 to active brothers who achieve above a 3.5 GPA and grants a $500 scholarship to pledges after their first quarter who rank in the top 20% of their pledge class. However, the most important key to our success comes from the culture of our brotherhood, where daily group studying and friendly competition is commonplace.
<br><br>
<b>Leadership and Government</b><br><br>
Our chapter specifically has a living constitution that has become central to our operations today. As a self-governing body, members vote yearly to elect fellow brothers to fill our executive and judicial branches of government, as well as any other vital roles to chapter management including House Manager and Social Chairs. As our chapter expands, these positions have become increasingly competitive, requiring nominees to develop and present platforms to impress the chapter. Elected individuals then take on the role as both the internal and external voices for the house, executing daily operations while representing the chapter to other Greek organizations as well as the university. These officials enter an environment of active debate and increased responsibilities, which challenge them to leave their individual interests behind and think critically about the future of the organization and the legacy of their tenures. Our democratic system thus serves as a template for political interactions found in all workplace environments with the helpful hand of brotherhood from letting it ever get too serious. Regardless of your son's aspirations within the organization, every member is a representative of our brotherhood and is held accountable to our standards, teaching your son the impact of his actions on a societal level. <br><br>

<b>Chair Positions and Events</b><br><br>

Gamma Nu also offers its members over 30 other chair positions, each with their own responsibilities to allow younger brothers a chance to move up in the community or give older brothers the opportunity to stay active. While the tasks of each chair vary by position, many chairs are actively involved in event planning and receive a budget, determined by our treasurer, to execute their undertaking. In many cases, this requires careful development and creating legitimate proposals to be verified prior to the event's date. An example includes our Alumni Banquet, which requires catering and agenda preparation, while depending on the planners' ability to give ample notification to alumni for a successful turn out. While all of the positions are mentored, we actively promote the development of time management skills in our members as an essential tool for success in the future, and the nature of our system allows that skill to develop in a controlled environment.
<br><br>
<b>Career Development</b><br><br>

One of the largest gaps between the average UCLA student and a Beta member comes in the area of career development, which can be difficult to understand in today's complex job market. In this department, Gamma Nu utilizes both its senior members and extensive alumni base to help prepare brothers for the next step. This includes a quarterly resume seminar for both active members and pledges by recent graduates to help brothers develop the format and language to help their resumes stand out. Many internships at prominent local LA offices, essential to developing experience in the field, are also passed down from older members through recommendations, giving brothers the advantage in the competitive search for summer jobs. As for alumni, Gamma Nu has a rich history at UCLA, holding the record for notable alumni donors among other fraternities, including 5 buildings on campus named after Beta alumni. In addition to our quarterly alumni events, many alumni are invited to give seminars regarding their field of expertise.
<br><br>
<b>External Involvement</b><br><br>

As an active member within the Greek associations on campus, Beta Theta Pi works to introduce its members to a variety of other fraternities, sororities and social organizations, designed to help reduce the intimidating feel of the large university into a close community of lifelong relationships and postgraduate connections. While various other institutions offer similar advantages, members of Gamma Nu have found that the memories and relationships developed during their four years at UCLA have given each of these opportunities a positive, lasting impact on their lives.
