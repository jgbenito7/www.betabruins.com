<h1>LETTER FROM THE RECRUITMENT CHAIR</h1>

<h2>Dear Potential New Members,</h2>

<p>
My name is Yves Beauzil and I am the 2014 Recruitment Chair for Beta Theta Pi.  As you explore our website, I hope it gives you a small preview of what our chapter is like and what we have to offer.  <br><br>

Being a member of Greek life at UCLA means much more than simply going to social events, wearing your letters, and attending chapter meetings each week.  Fraternities provide friendship and connections that last well beyond the college years. As a member of Beta Theta Pi, being in a fraternity means being part of a brotherhood that will stick with you for the rest of your life. With over 125 chapters, 6,500 members, and 125,000 alumni nationwide, Beta makes up one of the largest Greek networks in the country.  
<br><br>
Recruitment is one of the most exciting times of the year for any fraternity.  Here at UCLA, recruitment is a 4-day process during which potential new members are invited to meet and get to know members from all of the different fraternities on campus.  Since our chapter was founded at UCLA in 1926, we have taken pride in being one of the most well rounded fraternities on campus.  As a social organization with brothers involved in over 50 different clubs and organizations on campus, we are also proud to maintain the second highest GPA on the row.  
<br><br>
During the Recruitment period this fall, I encourage all of you to come out for rush.  For those that are most interested in rush please fill out a Recruitment Interest Form on our site so we can get to know you a little better.  The only way to truly know if a fraternity is right for you is to get to know the brothers in the house.  I invite all of you to stop by our house during the hours listed.  If you have any questions or concerns about the process feel free to send me an email.  I look forward to meeting all of you this fall. 
<br><br>
<center>Sincerely,</center><br>
<center>Yves Beauzil </center> 
<center>2014 Recruitment Chair for Beta Theta Pi</center></p>
