<h1>PARENTS</h1>
<h3>Dear Parents,</h3>
<p>My name is Matthew Ball, and I would like to personally thank you and your son for considering the Gamma Nu chapter of Beta Theta Pi and becoming part of our Fall 2014 pledge class. Whether you know it or not, your son's decision could bring your family into a national community of over 134,000 living members of an institution that has turned ambitious boys into successful men for over 150 years.
<br><br>
Like many of my colleagues, the fraternity system was a novelty to my family, and, in recent years, its reputation has been highly skewed by popular stereotypes in the media. Needless to say, my own parents were very skeptical. However, as senior year at UCLA approaches, I can proudly say that joining Beta Theta Pi was my greatest decision coming into the fall of my freshman year. At a large public university of over 28,000 undergraduates, Beta quickly introduces our new members to a tight knit community of around 100 brothers, all from various backgrounds culturally and educationally.
<br><br>
As UCLA students first and foremost, our chapter puts school at the forefront of our priorities. From Bio-Chemistry majors to History and Political Science majors, we pride ourselves in having one of the most diverse ranges in educational pursuits, while consistently ranking above the All Men"s, All Fraternity, and All Campus averages. This statistic has placed us in the top 3 average GPA's among other fraternities for the last four years. As a chapter, we provide multiple exclusive services to our members:
<br><br>
<li>
Reserved study rooms at the school libraries
</li><br>
<li>
Required study hours for struggling brothers
</li><br>
<li>
A sound-proof study room built below the chapter house
</li><br>
<li>
Quarterly scholarships to active brothers who achieve above a 3.5 GPA
</li><br>
<li>
An online test bank of previously used exams and study guides
 </li><br>
<br>
While education is important, Beta Theta Pi understands that the key to a successful future comes from outside the classroom. From leadership development to networking, the Beta experience works to graduate seniors who are confident in their futures by providing:
<br><br> 
A self-governing, yearly-elected body of both executive and judicial positions
A living constitution, open to propositions and active debate
A culture of accountability
Over 30 chair positions of varying responsibilities and event planning
Resume seminars by recent graduates
Quarterly alumni networking events 
Organized philanthropy events and local community projects
<br><br>
Lastly, as active members within the Greek associations on campus, Beta Theta Pi works to introduce its members to a variety of other fraternities, sororities and social organizations, designed to help reduce the intimidating feel of the university into a close community of lifelong relationships and postgraduate connections. While various other institutions offer similar advantages, I've found that the memories and relationships, developed during my years as a member of Beta, have given each of these opportunities a positive, lasting impact on my life and I know it will do the same for your son.
<br><br>
Thank you again for considering the Beta Theta Pi family and if you have any questions or concerns please contact us at betarecruitment2013@gmail.com.
<br><br>
