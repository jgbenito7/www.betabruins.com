<h1>Becoming a Member</h1>
<img src="/jpg/betapledges.jpg" class='pledges'>
<p>Membership in Beta Theta Pi is based on finding men who believe and live by the same set of fraternal values. These values, the Fraternity objects, are the basis for recruitment, pledging and a lifelong membership in our brotherhood. </p>
<h2>Recruitment</h2>
<p>At UCLA, Formal recruitment is usually a one-week period at the beginning of the fall and winter quarters hosted by the Interfraternity Council (IFC). Fraternities on campus will host events, which provide the opportunity to meet members and learn about each organization"s goals.  
 
During the recruitment period, potential new members are invited into our house to get to know as many of our 90 brothers as possible. However, you don"t necessarily need to participate in formal recruitment to join Beta Theta Pi. Informal recruitment lasts all year and you should seek out Betas on campus anytime to learn more about the Fraternity. <br><br>
 
It is important to keep in mind that Beta Theta Pi isn"t for everyone. Our Fraternity seeks to extend membership to a select few individuals who demonstrate the desire to make a positive contribution to our organization and who seek to maintain a lifelong devotion to our founding ideals: intellectual excellence, high standards of moral conduct, and commitment to the community. By joining Beta Theta Pi, you commit yourself to a high standard that all members are expected to meet</p>
<h2>Pledging</h2>
<p>Our pledging program is designed to orient new members to Fraternity history, including its traditions and practices, while also preparing each future brother for a lifetime of fraternal brotherhood. 

The primary objective of our pledge program is to produce informed, enthused, and principled new members ready to step into leadership roles in the fraternity and more importantly in the greater community and on campus.  Our pledge program ensures that each new member is not only ready to accept the committed of membership in our fraternity but also ready to make a positive contribution to Beta Theta Pi. Beta Theta Pi has no place for programs that create artificial probation, second-class citizenship or hazing</p>
<h2>Initiation</h2>
<p>Initiation is a special ceremony where the deepest symbolic meaning of the Fraternity is revealed and the full privileges of membership are extended to new members. While the ceremony has taken different forms, more than 180,000 members have been initiated since 1839. For all members in Beta Theta Pi, it is the beginning of a lifetime of friendship, learning, and personal growth.</p>
<h2>Lifelong Friendships</h2>
<p>Beta Theta Pi is not just a four-year experience. It is an experience that will stimulate lasting bonds of friendship and brotherhood. From undergraduate leadership opportunities to local alumni associations and General Conventions, the lifelong bonds of Beta brotherhood are inescapable.</p>
